\section{The unit of charge: the Coulomb}
% The elementary charge carried by the electron is $q_e = 1.6021766208(98) \times 10^{-19}$ C.\\
% Do you know intuitively what is the charge in one Coulomb?

% Let's imagine we can fix a positive charge A of one Coulomb in the ground. Let's have a crane where we hang a negative charge B of one Coulomb above the first at a distance $d = 100$ m. The two charges will attract each other, according to the Coulomb force.\\

\textbf{Question A:} What is the mass to be suspended on the other side of the crane to balance this system out? Compare this to a day-to-day life object.\\

{\color{blue}
The two charges will attract each other due to the electrostatic force. Let's compute $\vec{F}_{AB}$, the force exerted by the ground charge on the upper one.
It points downwards and we get the magnitude using Coulomb's law:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{F_{AB}} = k_e \frac{q_A \, q_B}{| \, \mathbf{r_{AB}}|^2} \: \mathbf{\hat{r}_{AB}}
\end{equation}
With the values we obtain:
\begin{equation}
 F_{AB} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \, \frac{1.00 \times 1.00}{  100 ^2}  = 899 \, \text{kN}
\end{equation}
That's a lot of force. To know the corresponding mass to hang on the other side, we need to have a weight hanging there with the same magnitude as $F_{AB}$. 
With Newton's first law of universal gravitation, we know the weight of an object of mass $m$ on Earth is defined as the force of gravity on the object. It is obtained using the relation:
\begin{equation}
 \vec{F}_\text{grav} = \vec{g} . m
\end{equation}
For the crane to be balanced, we must have $\vec{F}_{AB} = \vec{F}_\text{grav}$. Thus the mass is:
\begin{equation}
 m = \frac{F_\text{grav}}{g} = \frac{F_{AB}}{g} = \frac{899 \times 10^3}{9.81} = 91.6 \times 10^3 \text{kg} =  91.6 \, \, \text{tons}
\end{equation}

\textbf{We have to hang a big locomotive to balance two charges of 1 Coulomb separated by 100 metres!}

\textbf{Question B:} A typical lightning strike is about 40 coulombs of charge, typically consisting of four separate "strokes" (that's why lightning usually looks flickery). Each stroke lasts about 30 microseconds. What is the current?\\

{\color{blue}
The current is, by definition, a flow (amount) of charge per unit of time. We have for our strike:
\begin{equation}
 I = \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{40 }{30 \times 10^{-6} } = 1.33 \times 10^6 \text{A}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Our lightning strike has a current of 1.33 million amperes!}
\newline
To compare, when you charge your smartphone you are using roughly 1 Amp.

\section{The electron volt}
% An electron volt (eV) is the energy an electron gains when it is accelerated through a potential difference of one volt. An electron volt is defined as a unit of energy.\\
% 
% A Lindt 70\% cocoa chocolate bar has 194 Calories (one dietary Calorie is 1000 calories, or 4184 Joules).\\
% 
% The LHC operates at 14 TeV (tera eV, 10$^{12}$ eV).\\


\textbf{Question A:} How does the energy of the proton-proton collisions at LHC compare with respect to the energy stored in a cocoa chocolate bar?\\ 



\textbf{Question B:} Make the same comparison with energy density.\\

\textit{Data:} as volumes you can use these estimations as guideline:
    \begin{description}
        \item LHC: a proton has a volume of roughly 1 fm$^3$, or about 10$^{-39}$ cm$^3$
        \item Lindt 70\% cocoa chocolate bar is about 10 cm $\times$ 1/2 cm $\times$ 20 cm = 100 cm$^3$
