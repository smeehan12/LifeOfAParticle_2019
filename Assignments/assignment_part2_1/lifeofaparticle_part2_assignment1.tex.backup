\section*{Interpreting test beam data}

The following plot comes from real data taken at the DESY II testbeam facility in Hamburg, Germany.\\

A test beam telescope consists of aligned sensitive plates perpendicular to the beam direction $\vec{e}_Z$, which record the position 
A beam of electron of energy 1 GeV goes through six sensitive plates perpendicular to the beam direction. A test beam telescope etween the third and fourth plate) 

If you are curious, you can read more about the testbeam facilities and the telescopes here:

In class, we made a program to simulate a toy detector and overlay tracks.

We saw that the deflection of the passing particles on the last detector layer (11$^{11}$) can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution.
